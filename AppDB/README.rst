====================
 AppScale Datastore
====================

A server that implements the `Google Cloud Datastore`_ API. At this time, it
only supports v3 protocol buffer requests generated by the SDK runtimes.

One example of using this as a standalone service is redirecting datastore
requests from an application running in GAE to some other environment with
this service running.
